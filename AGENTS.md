# Agent Instructions

- Scope: These instructions apply to the entire repository.
- Prefer adding tests when changing application logic. Run `pytest` before completing your work whenever code (non-documentation) is modified.
- Keep documentation in sync with new features and configuration steps.
- When you touch API-facing code, update README examples if the public interface changes.
